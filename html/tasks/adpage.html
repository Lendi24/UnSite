            What makes one company's brand appealing to you more than another's?
            Do you have a favorite brand of toothpaste?
            A favorite type of pizza? <br>
            I'm guessing you love it all.
            Yet in a country of over 500 million people you can get a whole range of what you want at a low price.
            Now one thing I didn't like was the texture of the bite I took.
            The first bite didn't melt in my mouth. <br>
            I thought about adding my own bite to see if it would melt but decided against it.
            I'm not a fan of a long, slow poofy melt.
            I like the quick chew.
            The watermelon was sweet and the lime flavor was nice too.
            This tastes very much like the orange one and I would get that again.
            The watermelon flavor does go away and then the lime is almost too tart.
            Overall, though, I would
            life is about failing forward.
            we each live with purpose.
            this means we've always got a story to tell, and what is the worst that could happen if someone is
            listening?
            there is this lady in my building, i see her occasionally in the hall, and she was wearing a robe, hair
            disheveled, probably heading home from the gym, carrying a cup of coffee in her hands, and it was
            chilly, i
            saw a zippo lighter in the palm of her hand and this freaked me out a little bit.
            i don't know how to describe it, but i felt that this is a very strong statement that she is a survivor.
            she could have kept on going, and this woman has the courage and energy to do what most of us don't have
            in
            us, and i want to feel like i have the ability to write something positive today.
            you can't always control what happens to you in life, but you can control how you choose to react to it.
            we all have a reason to be here.
            we don't all get the same one.
            i see people every day, and many of them don't want to be here, but they are.

            fear is within us, it is not God we fear, it is what God fears.
            the scripture says,
            First of all, think about the time in the book of Genesis when God created the Earth.
            That didn't take long!
            Or the time God formed man from the dust.
            I mean, how about the book of Moses where God tells the Israelites they can conquer the
            of you and your circumstances.
            We have been born into this world with an infinite, free supply of energy.
            Even if we cannot control our circumstances, we can choose to control the way we react.
            To be honest, the way I react to
            When He came to His people, he rescued them from their sins, and they praised Him.
            The Bible says, "When the people saw the smoke of his face and the ruddy glow of his skin, they wept
            aloud."
            (Joshua 24: 4).
            His glory shone so brightly, that the people were frightened.
            Even Moses' mother was scared by the size and
            glory of God's appearance in his face.
            She said to him, "Son of man, this is the image you have made to me: You have made us in the likeness of
            God, and the likeness of God
            to receive your inheritance, which you have given to your sons."
            (Joshua 4: 8 - 9).
            God said, "You have seen Me, but I have not seen you."
            Then he took his clay imprint and created people and placed them on the mountain.
            (Joshua 4: 16).
            The only way to receive the promised gift of the inheritance is to
            "... it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure."
            Philippians 2: 13 God does not give us circumstances to
